# CV-O-MATIC
*A tool to help automate customizable CV creation.*

Multifaceted professionals are often faced with the challenge of communicating their usefulness to potential employers in the limited space of a CV. You must think carefully about what parts of yourself to highlight, and the challenge only grows with the volume of new skills and interesting experiences. Would an employer's problem be best addressed by your communication or your leadership skills? Or your arcane engineering powers? Or both?

Keeping track of multiple versions of a CV feels messy, and adapting your CV every time you have a new skill or a new work accomplishment is painful and time-consuming.

Voil√° - CV-O-Matic! This is a side project and a roundabout expression of my frustration for error-prone, back-and-forth formatting tweaking. 

The intended use is:
- Maintain a master database (private CSV) of all of your work experiences, skills, etc.
- Run CV-o-matic to translate this into a nice, easily-editable LaTeX document
- Keep track of new CV versions in separate directories. Organizational neatness - peace at last!

# Installation
